# Hi there, I'm Kyle Ingham ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I'm an enthusiastic learner with a diverse background and a passion for solving problems. My journey began as a high-level soccer player, which instilled in me an obsession for continuous skill building and personal development. After studying Economics at Brock University and gaining experience as a data analyst and in various management roles within the hospitality and tourism sectors, I discovered a fascination for quantitative investing. This led me to an ongoing four-year project exploring the ins and outs of the financial world. Through managing a large database on my own. I quickly discovered the benefits of learning to code and working with AI to simplify my tasks and create an efficient workflow.

Beyond my professional interests, I'm passionate about surfing, snowboarding and all things outdoors, which has taken me around the world in pursuit of the best waves and mountains. These experiences have enriched my understanding of different cultures. Over time, as my interests shifted from physical to mental challenges, I found coding to be a perfect fit for my problem-solving nature.

## Education

I am currently completing my diploma in Software Engineering at BrainStation, Canada. During my time here, I have developed several full-stack applications, including a capstone project, **Food Market**, which helps users compare grocery store prices to market averages and avoid price gouging. This application leverages data from monthly CPI reports from each province in Canada and allows users to create interactive shopping lists with pricing expectations and seasonal produce availability.

Prior to BrainStation, I studied Economics at Brock University, where I developed a strong foundation in data analysis and an understanding of market dynamics.

## Skills

- **Languages:** JavaScript, HTML, SASS, CSS, Python, MySQL
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** React, Node.js, Express, Vite, React-Router-DOM, Multer
- **Tools & Technologies:** Git, Axios, Capacitor
- **Areas of Interest:** Primarily back-end development, with a strong inclination toward data manipulation and analysis due to my background in data analysis and economics.

## Projects

- **[BrainFlix](https://github.com/Ingy10/kyle-ingham-brainflix):** A video streaming platform prototype built as a part of my coursework at BrainStation. It includes a custom API server, dynamic video display, interactive comments, and a responsive design.

- **Food Market (Capstone Project):** An innovative grocery store item price comparison app that helps users compare prices against market averages and track prices over time. Built with full-stack technologies similar to BrainFlix, it also utilizes Capacitor for offline use and app store deployment. I was the lead developer and was responsible for both the front-end and back-end development of the application.

- **Noojmowin Teg Project:** Developed dynamic forms for purchase orders, check requisitions, and mileage trackers for a non-profit organization funded by Health Canada. This project aimed at providing simple and efficient solutions to managing data so Noojmowin Teg employees can focus on healthcare solutions to Indigenous communities.

## What I'm Learning

Currently, I am diving deeper into free markets and quantitative investing, focusing on strategy momentum and factor momentum. I am actively running a live investment strategy that has been outperforming the S&P 500 for almost two years. On the technical front, I love exploring new ideas for applications and frequently draw inspiration from communities like Indie Hackers to refine my programming skills.

## Career Goals

Upon graduation, I am seeking a rewarding position that allows me to leverage my skills in software engineering and contribute meaningfully to an organization. My career shift was driven by a desire to create a stable and fulfilling life for my family, and I am eager to work in industries such as agriculture, oil & gas, finance, natural health or hospitality and tourism. However, I am open to exploring opportunities in various fields.
