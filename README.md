# Hi there, I'm Kyle Ingham ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I'm an enthusiastic learner with a diverse background and a passion for solving problems. My journey began as a high-level soccer player, which instilled in me an obsession for continuous skill building and personal development. After studying Economics at Brock University and gaining experience as a data analyst and in various management roles within the hospitality and tourism sectors, I discovered a fascination for quantitative investing. This led me to an ongoing four-year project exploring the ins and outs of the financial world. Through managing a large database on my own. I quickly discovered the benefits of learning to code and working with AI to simplify my tasks and create an efficient workflow.

Beyond my professional interests, I'm passionate about surfing, snowboarding and all things outdoors, which has taken me around the world in pursuit of the best waves and mountains. These experiences have enriched my understanding of different cultures. Over time, as my interests shifted from physical to mental challenges, I found coding to be a perfect fit for my problem-solving nature.

## Education

I recently completed a Diploma in Software Engineering at BrainStation, Canada. During my time there, I developed several full-stack applications, including my capstone project, Food Market. This application assists users in comparing grocery store prices to market averages, helping them avoid price gouging. The app leverages data from monthly CPI reports across Canadian provinces and allows users to log prices for the items they buy. These prices are stored in a personal database, enabling users to build a customized record of their usual purchases and the prices they typically pay.

After completing my BrainStation diploma, I immediately began a 16-week Data Science and Analytics program with M2M Tech based in Calgary, Alberta. This program will conclude with an industry-led project for which I will receive a stipend. I plan to leverage my coding skills to combine with data, making me a highly skilled and valuable candidate for any employer looking for a well-rounded, technical, and analytical team player.

Prior to BrainStation, I studied Economics at Brock University, where I developed a strong foundation in data analysis and an understanding of market dynamics.

## Skills

- **Languages:** JavaScript, HTML, SASS, CSS, Python, MySQL
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** React, Node.js, Express, Vite, React-Router-DOM, Multer
- **Tools & Technologies:** Git, Axios, Capacitor
- **Areas of Interest:** Full-stack development with a primary focus on back-end development, particularly in data manipulation and analysis, driven by my background in data analysis and economics.

## Projects

- **Food Market (Capstone Project):** An innovative grocery store price comparison app that enables users to compare item prices against market averages and build a personal database to track their usual purchases and prices over time. Built with React, JavaScript, HTML, SASS, CSS, and MySQL, the app leverages React, Node.js, Express, Vite and React-Router-DOM for seamless functionality. It will utilize Capacitor for offline use and app store deployment. As the lead developer, I was responsible for both the front-end and back-end development, employing tools like Git and Axios throughout the project.

- **Amazon Customer Reviews Enhancement Project:** In a 24-hour innovation sprint, our cross-functional team of eight tackled a key challenge for Amazon: improving the quality and authenticity of customer reviews while minimizing spam and manipulation. Using React.js, Node.js, JavaScript, Express.js, and SASS, we developed an interactive dashboard featuring AI-powered keyword analysis, advanced filtering options, and an enhanced review submission process to encourage more detailed feedback. I focused on designing a user-centric interface and ensuring review authenticity through careful data handling. Our efforts, guided by Agile methodologies and strong team coordination, culminated in a comprehensive proposal and a fully functional prototype, showcasing our ability to rapidly develop and present solutions to complex e-commerce challenges.

- **Shkagamik-Kwe Health Centre Project:** Developed dynamic forms for purchase orders, check requisitions, and mileage trackers for a non-profit organization funded by Health Canada. This project aimed at providing simple and efficient solutions to managing data so Shkagamik-Kwe employees can focus on healthcare solutions to Indigenous communities.

## What I'm Learning

I am currently expanding my expertise in data science and analytics through a 16-week program with M2M Tech, where I'm learning to integrate coding with data analytics to create impactful solutions. This course is deepening my understanding of how to harness data for meaningful insights, combining my coding skills with advanced analytical techniques. Additionally, I am broadening my programming knowledge by learning computer science fundamentals as well as languages like Python and C through the Harvard CS50 course, which is enhancing my problem-solving abilities and technical versatility.

## Career Goals

Upon graduation, I am seeking a rewarding position that allows me to leverage my skills in software engineering and contribute meaningfully to an organization. My career shift was driven by a desire to create a stable and fulfilling life for my family, and I am eager to explore opportunities in various fields.
